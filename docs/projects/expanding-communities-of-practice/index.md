# Expanding Communities of Practice

There will soon be information here about the NEH-funded project “Expanding Communities of Practice,” aimed at helping to create infrastructure for digital humanities across several higher education institutions across the U.S.

In January 2018, I was hired as a coordinator for the Digital Humanities Research Institute, a project supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), with the purpose of cultivating expanded communities of DH practice through professional development workshops, an inclusive pedagogical approach, and curricular materials for teaching foundational digital skills.

In June 2018, I was part of organizing a meeting for sixteen faculty, librarians, museum administrators, and staff at The Graduate Center, CUNY, for a ten-day, in-person institute. We provided professional development training that combined a pedagogical approach and core set of curricular materials and participants then worked with me over the following year to organize local versions of DHRI using our core curriculum or creating their own lessons. We emphasized that their workshops should reflect their communities’ interests and needs.

The first DHRI cohort returned to The Graduate Center in June 2019, sharing reflections about how their experience as part of the project impacted their professional development and future career goals. The result will be published later 2019 in a white paper through the NEH.

Early 2019, together with Project Director Lisa Rhody, I co-wrote a successful application to the NEH securing an additional $250,000 funding for another two years, expanding the project to include another DHRI cohort.

As part of my work with the DHRI, I [created a website for the project](http://www.dhinstitutes.org), where you can read more about our pedagogical, curricular, and social motivations for the project.
