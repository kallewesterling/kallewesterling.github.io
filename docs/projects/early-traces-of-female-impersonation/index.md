# Early Traces of Female Impersonation

My current research examines boylesque, a contemporary genre of neo-burlesque performance. In a part of the project, I conduct inquiries into historical data, attempting to find queer foundational structures in popular entertainment through social network analysis.

The beginnings of this project was funded through a Connect New York (CNY) research grant in Summer 2018:“Mapping Female Impersonators in Billboard’s and Variety’s Archives”. With the funding, I was able to begin creating a dataset that linked drag and “pansy” performers in New York City to burlesque theatres and nightclubs in the 1920s–30s. The research was primarily based on the archives of Billboard and Variety as they exist in their entire runs in ProQuest’s Entertainment Archive database. I also started mapping theatres and other venues where such performers regularly appeared.
