<p class="lead">Some of the code found online under my name was written mostly for learning purposes, but some of it showcases what I value in coding practice. I believe the best way of mastering a skill such as Python programming is by working in-depth in the tool itself and making sure to write sharp and accessible documentation along the way.</p>

For example, as I was reading about defunct social media platforms and analytical tools in Spring 2019, I came across the now non-operational TwitterSheep website. When it was operational, it created a tag cloud from the raw text of anyoneâ€™s followers on Twitter. I was unable to find any similar available tools, so I wrote an open-source version of what the site used to do: github.com/kallewesterling/twittersheep. I made sure to complement the code with clear and straightforward documentation on how to use the package.
