<p>Today, I regulated the amount of pages I need to read/scan through every day, from 89 pages/day to approximately 131.</p>
<p>The reason for my regulation was that I had not been reading as much during winter break as I was hoping, as well as a miscalculation on my part, because my list for the field on Critical Perspectives on the Body was not yet approved (it still isn't, but I have a better shot with my newly updated list). So my original number, 89, was based on an approximation.</p>
<p>The new page number to read per day, 131, is a more accurate number, taking into account both my previous reading habit as well as the new total amount of pages to read.</p>
<p>With my current reading efficiency (0.8â€“1.8 pages/minute), that would mean between 1h 12min and 2h 43min of reading per day.</p>
