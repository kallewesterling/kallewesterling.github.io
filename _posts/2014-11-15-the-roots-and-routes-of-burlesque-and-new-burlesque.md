<p class="lead">Burlesque is a genre that seems to have had nine lives, and historians and critics have kept defending its legitimacy. It has repeatedly been declared dead, taken up again, re-performed, picked apart, scorned, and reclaimed. It has been defined as pure comedy, erotic entertainment intended solely for men, but also offensive, feminist, and a queer art form.</p>
<p>The striptease and the figure of the stripper are usually regarded as central tropes of the genre. For example, during the "Golden Age" of burlesque — the 1910s–1930s — Gypsy Rose Lee is well-known for her attempt to legitimize the element of the stripper by renaming herself an "ecdysiast." But according to most historians of burlesque, the stripper and the striptease came about only later in the development of the form. The striptease is often blamed for bringing the genre’s Golden Age to an end, with closings of burlesque theaters in many cities around the end of the 1920s and the early 1930s; in New York, specifically, in 1937. But it is also integral to the millennial burlesque (or what has been referred to as "neo-burlesque"), indeed what defines it.</p>
<p>This historical field, then, will examine accounts of the roots of burlesque in Europe, particularly late 19th Century England and France, as well as its later history in New York City and around the United States. In addition to examining the way striptease functioned in burlesque, I am interested in pursuing such questions as: What was burlesque’s relationship to vaudeville and how was it circulated among other and later popular entertainments, including the musical revues, film and early television? What role does nostalgia play in "re-performances" of burlesque in the later the 20th century with shows such as <i>Sugar Babies </i>and Ann Corio's <i>This Was Burlesque </i>as well as the popular neo-burlesque movement?</p>
<p>Some of the historians and theorists will include Robert C. Allen, Rachel Shteir, Andrew Erdman, Robert M. Lewis, Andrew Davis, Neil Miller, and Michelle Baldwin.</p>
