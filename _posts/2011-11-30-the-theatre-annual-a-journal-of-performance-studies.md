<p>The Theatre Annual: A Journal of Performance Studies is the oldest theatre periodical continuously published in America. Founded in 1942 by the Theatre Library Association, Theatre Annual is now published in the fall of each year by The College of William and Mary in Virginia.</p>
<p>Theatre Annual publishes articles on the history and ethnography of performance, drawing from such areas as theatre studies, performance studies, popular culture, music, anthropology, communication, dance, philosophy, folklore, history, and the special areas of interest that cross disciplinary lines.</p>
<p>Scholars wishing to publish in Theatre Annual are invited to prepare their manuscripts in conformity with the guidelines in The Chicago Manual of Style (endnotes, no Works Cited list) and submit them as a Word attachment to the editor, Dorothy Chansky, Department of Theatre and Dance, Box 42061, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, USA 79409-2601.

Articles should be 5000-6500 words long including notes. Illustrations are highly desirable; authors are responsible for securing rights.</p>
<p>The 2012 issue will be an unthemed, general issue. Papers are welcome on any subject that fits the journal’s mission. Submission deadline is December 15, 2011. Please allow eight weeks for a response.</p>
