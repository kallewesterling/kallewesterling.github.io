<p>I just found out about <a href="https://www.vipercard.net/0.2/" target="_blank">Vipercard</a>, a virtual Javascript-version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/05/25-years-of-hypercard-the-missing-link-to-the-web/" target="_blank">HyperCard</a>, the first application I used for programming and was struck by a little nostalgia that I thought I may share here. HyperTalk was the programming language that HyperCard used, and it seems that this virtual machine actually works -- from the little that I was able to fiddle around with it.</p>
