<p><b>Minor field, advisor: Professor Peter Eckersall</b></p>
<p>The “digital revolution” of the past fifteen or twenty years has created not only new methods of (intercultural) communication and exchange, but also changed our ways of conceptualizing both performing arts generally, and the knowledge-production in and around the performing arts. In recent years, the field of Digital Humanities has been the locus for a more general, interdisciplinary conversation around these issues. The question of how the performing arts can fit into the discourse of digital humanities seems to be a fairly new one. For many scholars, the digital humanities and performing arts have been equated with the quantitative study of plays and other textual elements of theatre as well as movement in certain dance-related projects. In this field, I aim to understand the interaction between the field we call the “Digital Humanities” and Theatre and Performance Studies as a discipline in a more complex way.</p>
<p>The divide between “the digital” and “the analogue” has undergone an incredible change over the past ten years, and it has affected conversations within the larger field of Performance Studies and Theatre Studies as well. The arguments presented in (now classical) works such as Peggy Phelan’s <em>Unmarked: The Politics of Performance</em>, Philip Auslander’s <em>Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture</em>, and even Donna Haraway’s theorization of the cyborg and its many applications within the field of theatre and performance, have been vastly re-interpreted, re-contextualized, and re-visioned. In this field, I will look at the seeming contradiction between liveness and mediatization in theatre and performance in the 21st century, and focus specifically on three areas where these questions are coming to the fore.</p>
<p>First, on a very basic level, I will focus on questions of documentation of and archival practices around performances and productions, which also entails questions surrounding copyright and accessibility. Second, I will look at conversations around the use of digital technologies in performances, and by extension, what has been referred to as “new media dramaturgies”: a transformation of live performance taking the cue from new media and technologies. Third, I will focus on the questions arising in relation to the unstable dichotomy between analogue and digital surrounding the ontology of performance and its consequences for the aesthetic regimes of performing arts generally, as well as the temporality and location of performance.</p>
