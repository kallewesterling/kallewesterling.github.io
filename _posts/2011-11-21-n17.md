<p>I should be reading a lot for my classes at the moment, and also be in preparation for writing some upcoming exams, but something that is near and dear to my heart was on the rise the other day.<!--more--> On <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhQCpXM-Sm4" target="_blank">Nov 15, between 1am and 6p, Zuccotti Park and Occupy Wall Street was raided</a>, because they allegedly posed a "health risk" to the city. The immediate reaction was a rise of the movement, beyond what anyone (probably including New York's mayor Mike Bloomberg) could have believed was possible. On November 17, a march for public education and against tuition hikes was held. This march was very important to me, especially since I have all my life defended public free education in my homeland Sweden, and I want to carry this to my new home country, the United States.</p>
