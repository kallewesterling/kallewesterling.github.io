## Hayden White, "Historiography and Historiophoty"

- "Where imagistic evidence is lacking, historical investigation finds a limit to what it can legitimately assert about the ways things may have appeared to the agents acting on a given historical scene." Moved into seemlingly asking: What does it mean for history to be "better" told? "No history, visual or verbal, 'mirrors' all or even the greater part of the events or scenes of which it purports to be an account, and this is true even of the most narrowly restricted 'micro-history.' Every written history if a product of processes of condensation, displacement, symbolization, and qualification exactly like those used in the production of a filmed representation. It is only the medium that differs, not the way in which messages are produced."
- How long does a historical account need to be in order to be "accurate" or "proper"? "How much information is needed to support any given historical generalization?"
- Like the historical novel, the historical film draws attention to the extent to which it is a constructed or . . . a 'shaped' representation of a reality we historians would prefer to consider to be 'found' in the. events themselves or, if not there, then at least in the 'facts' that have been established by historians' investigation of the record of the past. But the historical monograph is no less 'shaped' or constructed than the historical film or historical novel. It may be shaped by different principles, but there is no reason why a filmed representation of historical events should not be as analytical and realistic as any written account."
- Written history, or historiography, is a "medium of representation" (1198)

# Thomas Postlewait and Charlotte M. Canning, "Representing the Past: An Introduction on Five Themes"

- "categorial imperatives": carry out research, compile evidence, develop analysis/explanation, and complete reports.
  - "shape, control, and even determine the archival procedures and assumptions that historians depend upon."
- five parts of "conceptual framework for historical representation" / "coordinates of the mind" / "categories of thought":
            (1) archive: "All \[historical representations] require documentation: access to and use of the historical archive (in its many manifestations, from public records to personal memories and oral reports)."
            (2) time,
            (3) space: "All representations, in the process of describing past events, require temporal and spatial coordinates."
            (4) identity,
            (5) narrative: "In the process of representing the past events, we draw upon narrative methods and assumptions (about the historical subjects and the time and place of their actions)."
  - "All five are necessary components of historical representation and are fundamental to performance historiography."
  - "have nothing to do with an interpretive strategy, a definitive position, a privileged viewpointm or model building."
  - "all of us, as we carry out our historical inquiry, _think with_—not just about—each of these five modes of comprehension in our tasks of representing the past."
- "All historians, no matter what their approach and subject matter, attempt to represent the past truthfully. . . . \[this] is often difficult to achieve because of the silences and lacunae of the past, especially as we move back through the centuries."
  - "despite these \[see below] various disjunctions, gaps, mediations, and configurations of historical inquiry and understanding, historians attempt to represent the past . . . as accurately and fully as possible . . . still committed to the principle of historical truth. Anything less is irresponsible."
- Paradox of representation: both truthful "facsimile" and "simulacrum, a copy and a counterfeit."
- Any historian aims for similiture or verisimilitude in their representation of the past: "The aim of telling the truth about past events is a necessary first principle of historical inquiry, but whose truth, what truth, which truth?"
- Quotes Ankersmit's Historical Representation:
  - "Though historical representations are built up of true descriptions, a (historical) representation itself cannot be interpreted as one large (true or false) description."
  - "The three central notions of philosophy of language—reference, meaning, and truth—have to be redefined in order to come to an adequate understanding of the nature of representation. Reference should be replaced by 'aboutness': a representation does not refer to what it represents, but is about it. Meaning has to be replaced by 'intertextuality': the meaning of the text of a historical representation can never be identified if one takes into account only the text itself. Its meaning only revels itself in a comparison with other texts about (roughly) the same represented. And this necessarily has its consequences for the notion of truth. Representations are not true or false in the proper, technical sense of these words, but only more or less plausible."
- "language (the dominant semiotic code) intervenes in historical representation . . . it mediates between the past events and each historian's configuration (or reconfiguration of them. Our descriptions of historical events and conditions depend upon—and are limited by—the available discourses that we have access to (and have facility in)."
- Takes it to mean that we are in "an inescapable hermeneutical entanglement of intertextuality that resides equally in the nature of historical events and the language we must use to describe or recover those events. Even if it teases most historians out of thought, the troubling idea of representation remains an underlying condition of historical thinking."
  - (Why do I want to make note of this? Because there is a risk in using visualization and/or some form of "data analysis," that we take it to mean "the truth," or that there is an assumption on the part of the historian who conducts such an investigation, that they somehow have escaped such a troubling idea. I do not want to perpetuate such a perspective. Rather, I want to use the digital technologies to both show that they can be beneficial in pointing out histories that we may have yet to understand how they relate to one another, but also how these networks—the nodes and edges portrayed here—are deliberately chosen and rendered, much like any other historiographic attempt.)
- Yet one more layer: "our historical sources, such as written documents and records, are already mediated representations of the historical actions, events, and thoughts that we seek to recover . . . representations by the historical agents and eyewitnesses, who themselves must negotiate their own double winds within the codes of representation." So: "Even 'primary' documents are 'secondary' in their representational codes."
- Postlewait and Canning speak here of temporal and spatial disjunctions between "the identities of the historical subjects and the identity of the historian."
- Why is causality not part of the central concepts of the book (which could have been, since Louis O. Mink names his four central tenets of historiography time, space, identity, causality)? "we have . . . circumscribed it within . . . the idea of _narrative_ because we wanted to show how and why causal factors, for the historian, are usually located in methods of not only identifying historical agents and their motives but also giving order and meaning to their actions."
- "History and historiography join together in the making of the narratives. Narrative form is thus central to historical understanding, over and beyond the ways in which it also provides many of the formal traits, tropes, genres, and rhetorical voices for historical writing."
- _Archive_: "establishes the framing network for all methods of investigation." + describe the struggle, especially of dance, "to document performance records of the body in motion, beyond the familiar written sources."
  - = Claire Sponsler + Susan Foster + Shannon Jackson /* to read */
  - "The task is to find new ways to locate and identify the performers and creators, to describe motion in space as well as time, to join formal analysis of performance to cultural history, to recover the perceptions and responses of the audiences, and to write historical narratives that are true to the explicit and implicit narratives of dance itself. What qualifies as evidence; what qualifies as performance? And, for the dance scholar, what are the descriptive and interpretive possibilities for historical reconstruction?"
- Draws on Derrida in describing the archive as engaging in "two meanings of 'source.'" The first is the more commonplace idea that source = information/data. "The other idea of source is more conceptual; it is understood as a beginning or initiating cause. Though these meanings are sometimes collapsed together in a confusing manner by some historians . . . we fully agree with Derrida that the source—as document and archival process—'produces as much as it records the event.'"
  - This means that the ARCHIVE = "a category of thought" (see above), "a way of conceiving and reconceiving the identities and meanings of past events."

## Susan Bennett, "The Making of Theatre History"

- 21st century theatre scholars: "look to an archive that is radically different from that of even a few years ago."
- Borrows from Ann Stoler, who describes "enquiry into the grids of intelligibility"
- Goal of chapter: "to review assumptions and practices as they shape theatre history and to point to continuing gaps in our discipline's archive. This is an argument, then, about the interplay of conservation and loss."
- From "archival evidence" —> "necessity of 'complex negotiation of the space between thing and theory'" (quoting Helen Freshwater) = "a much different vista of what constituted theatre across the centuries and has enabled the study of individuals, institutions, and performances that encompass both Western and Eastern geographies as well as a dazzling variety of production and reception contexts."
- This article: both heralds "an extraordinarily expsanded archive for the making of theatre history," and critiques: "it is timely . . . to annotate some omissions . . . and to speculate on limitations of the historiographical turn we call revisionist history."
- 2 "spheres of activity at the heart of this revision of theatre history:
  1. "a commitment to inclusion . . . driven in the 1990s by the prevalence of identity-based theorizing."
  2. "the recovery of what has been previously 'lost.'" Points out that it depends of "what is recognized as valuable by the field as a whole."
- Derrida informs Bennett's work: "archivization produces as much as it records an event."
- What constitutes an archive?
  - It is important to Bennett to ask this question (**and I think for me to ask the same question, following on the chapter on Morris**) because we have something to "gain by turning further toward a politics of knowledge that reckons with archival genres, cultures of documentation, fictions of access, and archival conventions." (Ann Stoler)
  - Archive = "privileged site of memory" (reformulating Pierre Nora's ideas) and "a rigorous and highly specialized process of forgetting" (quoting Joseph Roach).
- A definition of the archive, which provides some guidance as to why it is important to uncover the networks around Morris: the archive is a "centre of interpretation" (Bennett is quoting Thomas Osborne here)
  - I.e. the archve is implicated in knowledge production: it provides us with a "gesture of _setting aside_, of putting together, of transforming certain classified objects into 'documents.'" (quoting de Certau)
    - Grounds this in Foucault: "There is no political power without control of the archive, if not of memory." = it is a "yield of the discursive practice of the epistème," i.e. the way that we determine "what can be said," or the appearance here of a "statement" (or in this case a "life") as a "unique event."
- Burlesque archives have functioned much like Bonnie Smith writes about women's archives: in a "diasporic relationship to the official archival enterprise of the nineteenth century. . . . Papers about women \[read: burlesque performers] survived in various places—the attics of suffragists, flea markets, dank basements, local libraries, crumbling chaâteaus, government repositories—with very little concern for their preservation, in contrast to the attention given to highly prized, primary documents about men."
  - In this regard, drag stripteasers are no different from female burlesque artists who have not generally—until very recently—been considered worthy of historical appraisal and acclaim. However, I want to emphasize here, that there is a risk in the unburying of such archival material, that we lose sight of performers who were not performing genders conforming with concomitant heteronormative norms.

## Tracy C. Davis, "Questions for a Feminist Methodology in Theatre History"

- "most of the published work on women and theatre fits comfortably in one of two categories":
  1. recovery/revision: "which highlights women's activities in contrast or opposition to dominant traditions"
  2. "feminist literary criticism complementing historians' work by reclaiming 'lost' plays and uncanonized playwrights, providing an alternate reading of texts, and reprinting and publishing modern plays by women."

## Ann Laura Stoler

- Archival work done by postcolonial anthropologists, she critiques, "tends to remain more an extractive than an ethnographic one." In its place, "Scholars need to move from archive-as-source to archive-as-subject."

Questions that arise from these notes:

- Does boylesque exist —> What function does a historical/genealogical concept such as "boylesque" have in our contemporary society? [This is somewhat a Foucauldian attempt to ask a research question about boylesque.]
  - The term itself risks to subsume/discipline the idea of gender transgression in burlesque more broadly, and contain it (or name it) as part of dichotomous gender-play.
  - On the other hand, it also helps to disarm toxic masculinity and introduce a playful mode of gender performance into other, adjacent genres that may not be entirely transgressing traditional gender roles: burlesque (where performers sometimes appear in the nude which may risk a "medical" reading of bodies, only possible to subvert with "extreme" transgressive bodies), drag (where performers often, especially following the popular television show _RuPaul's Drag Race_ which have similar analoguous cultural moments in history, appear in "passing"; here I mostly describe drag queen performance), or male striptease (which often, as many studies have showed, tend to exaggerate male gender stereotypes in concordance with a heteronormative framing of the form of entertainment more generally).
