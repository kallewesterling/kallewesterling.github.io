  | ‚ÄúPerforming Under Pressure‚Äù: Life, Labor, and Art in the Academy

</title>
<meta name="description" content="Kalle Westerling is a performance scholar and historian. His doctoral research focused on itinerant drag performers around New York and along the Eastern Seaboard in the 1930s as part of a collective art form that brought queerness with them to towns and cities around the area. He has also written on topics ranging from queer indie wrestlers, boylesque and male-identified strippers in neo-burlesque, and the influence of RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race on the livelihood and aesthetics of contemporary New York City drag queens.

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><em>When: April 13-14, 2012</em></p>
<p><em>Where: Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies, Brown University, Providence, RI</em></p>
<p><em>Deadline: Dec 20, 2011</em></p>
<p>We work here. But where is ‚Äúhere,‚Äù and how do we define the ‚Äúwork‚Äù that we do? Beginning with these questions about the corporate university, ‚ÄúPerforming Under Pressure‚Äù intends to make visible the invisible work of students and scholars (when most academics don‚Äôt call themselves workers). We enjoin academics and artists in the humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and physical sciences to think about their field and the work they do, by: paying attention to what pressures are in play across class, racial, gender, and sexual lines and how such performances play out in the institutional framework in which we do our work; critically reflecting on how images of ourselves as students, academics, and teachers are constructed; and considering how these identities remain distinct from, and are also sustained by, the institution that gives rise to them.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs attempt something like a Brechtian exposure of the university‚Äôs workings; in creatively thinking about the things we do, and how they are done. We‚Äôll explore the economic basis for the university, and how it is covered over by long-held assumptions about what goes on at an educational institution; it is not for nothing that Brown University‚Äôs governing body is ‚ÄúThe Corporation.‚Äù The university reflects the stratifications of labor--these people pay (students in unfunded MFA and MA programs, who will leave the academy to join the ‚Äúreal‚Äù economy) and these other people get paid (funded PhD students and professors who remain in the ‚Äúunreal‚Äù university economy)‚Äîeven while it retains the veneer of pursuing knowledge for knowledge‚Äôs sake. Or, more troubling: becomes an incubator for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù skills for graduates who will become actors in the finance world. (The Brown website advertises: ‚ÄúA Brown education is a catalyst for creativity and entrepreneurship.‚Äù)</p>
<p>Possible topics include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p></p><li>The labor‚Äîaffective, immaterial, and other‚Äîof the scholar in the neoliberal university</li>
<p></p><li>Artists, performers, and culture workers in the university</li>
<p></p><li>How ‚Äúlife‚Äù is constructed by and within the academy, with reference to race, gender, dis/ability, etc.</li>
<p></p><li>University-based arts funding practices, forms of curation, and valuation schemes</li>
<p></p><li>Government and non-government sources of research funding</li>
<p></p><li>Collaborations with business and connections to the knowledge economy</li>
<p></p><li>The global university as it participates in forms of off-shoring</li>
<p></p><li>Campus sites that reflect on real world institutions: galleries, laboratories, markets, newspapers, and political forums</li>
<p></p></ul>
<p>This two-day conference will feature keynote speakers including Nicholas Ridout (Queen Mary, University of London) and Patricia Ybarra (Brown University), plenary paper sessions, forums with invited speakers in a ‚Äúlong table‚Äù format, and performance events.</p>
<p>Submissions welcome from all humanities and social and hard science disciplines and approaches. We are asking for you to present your work to the conference if you can also bring a discussion of the labor that went into it, and of the negotiations behind it. We are looking not for studies of the university per se, but papers and proposals that reflect on our own practice. Please select one of the following options and email your response along with a short bio to performingpressure@gmail.com.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<p></p><li>Papers: Please submit a 300-word abstract for a 20-minute paper relating to one or more conference themes.</li>
<p></p><li>Long Table: Please submit a short (200 words or less) description of your research topic(s) and a list of key terms relevant to your work.</li>
<p></p></ol>
<p>THE DEADLINE FOR ALL ABSTRACTS AND INQUIRIES IS DECEMBER 20, 2011. Please save the dates, plan to join us, and share this announcement with your colleagues and contacts. For more information, or to watch the conference take shape in a shared planning space, direct your web browser to: <a href="http://performingunderpressure.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://performingunderpressure.wordpress.com</a>.</p>
