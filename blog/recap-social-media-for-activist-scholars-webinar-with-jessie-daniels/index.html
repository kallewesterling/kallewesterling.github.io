  | Recap: Social Media for Activist Scholars Webinar with Jessie Daniels

</title>
<meta name="description" content="Kalle Westerling is a performance scholar and historian. His doctoral research focused on itinerant drag performers around New York and along the Eastern Seaboard in the 1930s as part of a collective art form that brought queerness with them to towns and cities around the area. He has also written on topics ranging from queer indie wrestlers, boylesque and male-identified strippers in neo-burlesque, and the influence of RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race on the livelihood and aesthetics of contemporary New York City drag queens.

    <p class="post-meta">May 17, 2017</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In her May 9 webinar Social Media for Activist Scholars, Jessie Daniels recently made some really great points, which I wanted to type out here:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p> </p><li>2009 was the year when social media took off.</li>
<p> </p><li>In 2014, 55% of academic faculty used social media in some way, shape or form, and 41% of them used it in their teaching. A majority of scholars use social media for self-promotion of work and connecting to other academics.</li>
<p> </p><li>A <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047523">2012 study by X. Shuai and Pepe A. Bollen</a> shows that about one-third of all academics use Twitter.</li>
<p> </p><li>Social media isn‚Äôt just changing the job we‚Äôre doing as academics but also, of course, changing activism: Examples of thousands of people showing up at protests, organized by bloggers and social media users.</li>
<p> </p><li>There are three kinds of scholar-activists, Daniels argues, the ‚Äúdedicated,‚Äù the ‚Äúborder-crosser,‚Äù and the ‚Äúaccidental.‚Äù

<p></p><ul>
<p> </p><li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/alondra" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alondra Nelson</a>¬†exemplifies¬†the¬†<b>dedicated scholar-activist</b>, who has spent years and years of building relationships and trust with informants via social media. She says herself that she uses social media to reach both informants and audience for her research.</li>
<p> </p><li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/zeynep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zeynep</a>¬†Tufekci exemplifies¬†the <b>border-crossing scholar-activist</b>, who uses social media to cross over from academic discourse to a journalist discourse. She says that ‚Äúacademics don‚Äôt pitch enough to media,‚Äù and is now writing a monthly column in the New York Times. Sometimes she gets up to 100,000 responses from readers. (Daniels reminds us: Keep in mind if you want to reach an enormous audience, that it opens up yourself to criticism and trolls, who will find every little mistake you make. It is NOT for the faint of heart, she says!)</li>
<p> </p><li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/lollardfish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David M. Perry</a> exemplifies¬†the <b>accidental scholar-activist</b>, whose identity as an academic is the primary identity. Activism is something that came through the social media itself. He crowdsourced Twitter for examples of academic job ads with ableist and illegal statements and then published a scathing article with Al Jazeera. Twitter can help encounter networks that you wouldn‚Äôt else have encountered.</li>
<p></p></ul>
<p></p></li>
<p></p></ul>
<p>Then Daniels spoke to some of the lessons learned from starting her popular blog around her research, in <a href="http://www.racismreview.com/"><i>Racism Review</i></a> (which she created in 2007). Here are the most important points to me:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p> </p><li>Don‚Äôt start out thinking you'll blog every day. Rather, reflect on¬†<strong>your long-term plan,¬†</strong>especially if you want this to be a blog that will last for a long time.</li>
<p> </p><li>Think about <strong>what your content</strong> is. If you‚Äôre an academic, you want to make sure you create content that counts toward tenure, etc. In Daniels‚Äô case, she says that she has written tweets that have turned into a blog post, and eventually a peer-reviewed paper.</li>
<p></p></ul>
<p>Daniels most importantly gave us her most valuable lessons learned from her own proliferate tweeting. Here are my favorites:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p> </p><li>Choose a short <strong>handle for your account</strong> - easy to remember, to tag you in posts. Also, Daniels reminds us to create an account name that is not identified with your institution‚Äînot to distance yourself from the institutions, but what happens if you change? Are you going to create a new Twitter account?</li>
<p> </p><li>Ask yourself <strong>what you have to contribute</strong> to the conversation: What do you bring to the conversation that is already happening‚Äîinsights from your research or personal experiences? Then, tell your story by talking with people and not at them. Twitter is not for making advertisements for yourself. The thing that drives social media is storytelling.</li>
<p> </p><li><strong>Make tweeting part of your daily routine</strong>‚Äîgo on Twitter when you have coffee in the morning, for instance. But analogously: know when to log off, close your laptop, and go for a walk.</li>
<p> </p><li><strong>Find people you want to connect with</strong> and reduce the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù (the stuff that fills your feed with the information you don‚Äôt want or need). If you don‚Äôt know how to connect with someone (a "key influencer" perhaps), retweet them with an added comment of yours. That‚Äôs a good tip, as that‚Äôs often how the first step in conversation starts.</li>
<p> </p><li>Paradoxically (perhaps), <strong>Twitter can help you meet people face-to-face</strong>. For academics, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to recognize someone from Twitter and start talking to them at conferences. Make sure to look at hashtags for events, and say hello to people. Twitter can function as a great ice breaker.</li>
<p></p></ul>
<p>Finally, Daniels made a crucial point. She reminded us that as academics, we need to think about how activists or anyone outside of academy will find, read, and share our work. We‚Äôre not usually trained in this. We‚Äôre just taught how to get published‚Äînot in thinking about the institutions that publish our work. If you publish your research on activism, for instance, behind a paywall, the activists who you may want to reach cannot read it without sometimes paying up to $60 for an article.</p>
<p>Daniels' solution? Choose open-access publishing, request information from your academic institutions about their publicly available institutional repositories, or put the research on your website. If you are publishing in a journal behind a paywall, can you share a pre-print version of your research? Most journals behind paywalls allow for this.</p>
