  | Digital Humanities Projects in the Performing Arts

</title>
<meta name="description" content="Kalle Westerling is a performance scholar and historian. His doctoral research focused on itinerant drag performers around New York and along the Eastern Seaboard in the 1930s as part of a collective art form that brought queerness with them to towns and cities around the area. He has also written on topics ranging from queer indie wrestlers, boylesque and male-identified strippers in neo-burlesque, and the influence of RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race on the livelihood and aesthetics of contemporary New York City drag queens.

    <p class="post-meta">September 28, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This September, I initiated a project of listing digital humanities projects of interest to/within the field of performing arts, a first step on the way towards my second comprehensive exams in my Ph.D. program at The Graduate Center, CUNY, where I am planning on doing one of my three fields on <em>digital humanities in the performing arts</em>. In the long run, I am intending on creating a non-traditional, potentially digital born dissertation about male bodies on the 20th and 21st century burlesque stages of New York City. By listing these projects, I am intending on getting some inspiration and more extensive knowledge of previous work that has been done, and finding my own voice in that flow of intellectual work.</p>
<p>My first (public) step in attempting to list such projects was to send this tweet into the universe:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/kallewesterling/status/516342236007919616</p>
<p>Before tweeting, of course, I had done some research myself, and the list below is by no means a comprehensive list (yet!) but I am still working on the list and will keep updating it as I am finding more interesting projects to write about.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs an open question, I think, the way certain subjects or disciplines fit within the larger project of Digital Humanities. I am only now learning what "digital humanities" can refer to (and also how I have been involved in projects like this all along). One of my favorite questions were posed in 2012 on Twitter:</p>
<p>http://twitter.com/mikejonesmelb/status/186749628224507905</p>
<p>The question of how performing arts can fit into the discourse of digital humanities seem to be a fairly new one. Here are some links that I have found useful to find conversations about digital humanities and performing arts online:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p></p><li>IFTR now has a <a href="http://www.firt-iftr.org/working-groups/methodologies/digital-humanities-in-theatre-research/" target="_blank">working group</a> focusing specifically on the "kinds of questions we can ask about theatre and performance." They also have a <a href="http://dhandtheatreresearch.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress site</a>.</li>
<p></p><li>In June 2013, the Martin E. Segal Theatre Center at The Graduate Center, CUNY organized <a href="http://performingarts2013.thatcamp.org/" target="_blank" title="THATCamp Performing Arts: Presenting and Archiving Performance in the Digital Age">the first THATCamp specifically on performing arts</a> (as far as I know), which focused more specifically the presentation and archiving of performance today.</li>
<p></p></ul>

<h1>List of Some Interesting DH Projects in the Performing Arts</h1>
<p>[red_box]Please note that this list is still under construction as of September 2014 and it will keep growing. Contribute your own suggestions in the comments below![/red_box]</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3minstr/" target="_blank" title="The Juba Project: Early Blackface Minstrelsy in Britain 1842‚Äì1852">The Juba Project: Early Blackface Minstrelsy in Britain 1842‚Äì1852</a></h3>
<p>A database where users can search "the Minstrelsy Database" which features information on the individuals and troupes who toured Britain between 1842 and 1852 in what became known as "minstrel shows," where individual entertainers appearing in blackface make-up performed together on stage. The site also features some antiquarian cartography, plotting locations of minstrelsy-related venues in seven cities visited by blackface performers during these the years: Brighton, Bristol, Liverpool, London, Newcastla, Nottingham, and Sheffield. The site seems to be under development, but has not been updated since 2005. Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lauraemacdonald" target="_blank" title="Laura MacDonald on Twitter">@lauraemacdonald</a> for linking me to the project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/about/" target="_blank">MIT Global Shakespeares</a></h3>
<p>An open-access archive of Shakespeare performances around the world, offering great resources for anyone teaching Shakespeare to undergraduate and graduate students, and who are interested in illustrating how Shakespeare's work is understood, interpreted, and performed in a global context. It has many videos of individual scenes from productions, complete with full plot summaries, information on the production teams, and easy navigation to related videos similar to the one you are watching. <em>Global Shakespeares</em> also features some microsites, such as <em><a href="http://web.mit.edu/shakespeare/asia/" target="_blank">Shakespeare Performance in Asia</a></em>, which seems to not have been updated since May 2013 (when it had technical difficulties).</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://americantheatrearchiveproject.org/" target="_blank">The American Theatre Archive Project</a></h3>
<p>A project, initiated by the <a href="http://www.astr.org/" target="_blank" title="American Society for Theatre Research">American Society for Theatre Research</a> attempting to support theatre artists in their attempts to archive records of their work. The database is open-access, and the website also features some great <a href="http://americantheatrearchiveproject.org/resources-list" target="_blank">resources</a> for artists as well as archivists.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://mith.umd.edu/mto/" target="_blank">Music Theatre Online: A Digital Archive for Music Theatre Scholarship</a></h3>
<p>A digital archive devoted to digital materials surrounding musical theatre, based at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities. Currently, it seems that the website is still under development, and the only musical accessible is <em>Glory Days</em>. The archive has the possibility of annotating text (potentially together with other scholars?) and listening to songs alongside with the reading of librettos. Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dougreside" target="_blank" title="Doug Reside on Twitter">@dougreside</a> (project director) for linking me to the project.</p>
<p>http://vimeo.com/6867241</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://ensemble.nypl.org/" target="_blank" title="Ensemble (NYPL Project)">Ensemble</a></h3>
<p>Ensemble is a website where users are able to assist the Billy Rose Theatre Division at the New York Public Library in the effort of transcribing historical theatre programs. It has a clear structure, and guides the user to transcribe each bit of the program into the correct categories, to build a database which presumably will be accessible to scholars and students in the future as well (?). Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dougreside" target="_blank" title="Doug Reside on Twitter">@dougreside</a> (project curator) for linking me to the project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/02/11/announcing-libretto" target="_blank" title="Libretto (NYPL Project)">Libretto</a></h3>
<p>Libretto is an open-source, reader which makes the user able to read musicals on Android devices, and, when available, hear music or see sheet music for the musical. The app currently comes bundled with a draft of the 1866 musical, <em>The Black Crook</em> with book by Charles M. Barras, and music and songs that were primarily adaptations for the musical. The app can be downloaded from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nypl.libretto" target="_blank" title="Download Libretto">Google Play</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dougreside" target="_blank" title="Doug Reside on Twitter">@dougreside</a> for linking me to the project.</p>
<p></p>

Will feature map of Broadway shows as the open and close in the 1940s; database with details of performance history; data about other theatrical fields, for instance London. Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DerekKMiller" target="_blank" title="Derek Miller on Twitter">@DerekKMiller</a> for linking me to the project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://sites.duke.edu/dukeinlaramie/" target="_blank" title="The Laramie Project">The Laramie Project ‚Äî Teaching example</a></h3>

<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://ctda.library.miami.edu/productions" target="_blank" title="The Cuban Theatre Digital Archive">Cuban Theatre Digital Archive</a></h3>
<p>An open-access database committed to archiving original materials and scholarship on the history Cuban theater, by filming live performance, digitizing existing theatre on tape, and preserving physical materials. They encourage participation by the community of theatre artists, patrons, academics, students, and other volunteers in the contribution of archival materials.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://dramainthedelta.org/" target="_blank">Drama in the Delta</a></h3>
<p>Drama in the Delta is a 3D game environment, created by a team directed by Emily Roxworthy, Associate Professor of Theatre and Dance. The user is able to choose one of many different avatars, in order to explore different outcomes of Roosevelt‚Äôs decision to imprison 120,000 Japanese Americans in internment camps in 1942.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.oldabbeytheatre.net/" target="_blank">Abbey Theatre, 1904</a></h3>
<p>3D models have opened up new ways of exploring stories and histories of theatres that are long gone. This project is an example of the attempt to create a digital model of Dublin's original Abbey Theatre, as it looked on its opening night. The model was created in 2011.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://humviz.org/set/index.html" target="_blank">Simulated Environment for Theatre</a></h3>
<p>The Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET) is another example of a 3D environment, developed by a multidisciplinary team, in which the user can create a model of a stage, see an actor's or dancer's movement in space, along with spoken lines, etc. An academic paper about the SET visualizations, "Visualizing Theatrical Text: From Watching the Script to the Simulated Environment for Theatre," can be found in <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/3/000166.html" target="_blank" title="Visualizing Theatrical Text: From Watching the Script to the Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET)">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a>.</p>

<p>http://www.vimeo.com/45494725</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.stagingchina.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="Staging China">Staging China</a></h3>
<p>A project that came out of the research project Performing China on the Global Stage at University of Leeds, aimed at reinvigorating Chinese theatre and simultaneously address the lack of electronic resources, such as "recorded performances, bilingual English and Chinese annotations of recordings, contextual information about Chinese theatre and critical analysis." The website features video, written material, biographies, and bibliographies, images, and much more.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.debracaplan.com/dytp.html" target="_blank" title="Temporary website for the Digital Yiddish Theater Project">The Digital Yiddish Theater Project</a></h3>
<p>A project attempting to adopt digital humanities tools and methodologies in order to study and preserve Yiddish theater, run by Debra Caplan, Assistant Professor at Baruch College.

<h3><a href="http://www.padb.net/" target="_blank" title="Performance Artist Database website">Performance Artist Database</a></h3>
<p>Website constructed by Pratt MFA student <a href="http://thisismattmiller.com/" target="_blank" title="Matt Miller's website">Matthew Miller</a>, using Gephi modeling/quantitative network analysis to "study the development of artistic movements and mediums." The website has a specific focus on the Fluxus movement, but the method would be applicable to many projects beyond that movement.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="http://brooklyndragarchive.org/" target="_blank" title="Brooklyn Drag Archive">Brooklyn Drag Archive</a></h3>
<p>With recent mass-migrations from Facebook over the heated debate around the company's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/fashion/drag-performers-fight-facebooks-real-name-policy.html" target="_blank">name policy</a>, there have been strides to create new safe spaces for queer lives and art forms online, among them drag performance. The <em>Brooklyn Drag Archive</em> is an attempt to archive and conserve performance content from this specific culture, an "online space that‚Äôs hospitable to drag and created by drag performers and their admirers."</p>
